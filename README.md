# Chats

A simple chat application that lets you create topics and discuss about the topics with other connected users in real-time. The chat data is not persistent. So, once you leave the browser, the data gets erased from your browser.

You can check out the live demo [here](https://madi031.github.io/Chats/).

Server code can be found [here](https://github.com/madi031/Chats-Server).
